# Calibration-by-QCs
Various approaches have been used to reduce systematic non-biological error which is frequently occurs within and between batches in metabolomics data sets. Direct scaling, using the total signal intensity, labeled internal standards for every analyte, or a representative Internal Standard, tends to suppress the sensitivity of the analyses and thus may lead to a loss of information. 

Reducing systematic nonbiological error by periodically analyzing pooled samples (PQCs) along with the subject samples is gaining acceptance as a quality control strategy in metabolic profiling. Despite their success, PQC-based calibration methods have a limited capacity to adjust batch and injection order effects lacking the pretreatment of the PQC data beforehand. Additionally, the calibration process is laborious and prone to human error. Therefore, we developed a seven-step workflow and software to calibrate metabolomics data sets by pooled samples as quality controls (PQCs). The software can adjust both within- and between-batch variance and perform rough, medium, and precise calibrations. Calibrated data sets derived from various platforms can be combined directly. It is user friendly with an integrated GUI, has lots of options, and is independent to data sources.
